// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

User input x1, x2
Add x1 + x2 = Sum
Print "Sum = "Sum



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

User input x1
If x1%2 === 0 then EVEN NUMBER else ODD NUMBER
If x1 is ODD NUMBER then print "Odd"
If x1 is EVEN NUMBER then print "Even"



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) User Input x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 from range 101
b) Add x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = sum
   Divide sum/5 = avg
c) maxnumber = max(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)
   minnumber = min(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)
d) Print "Average is "avg
   Print "Minumum number is "minnumber
   Print "Maximum number is "maxnumber
